# Deployment Guide for UFDev Agency Website

This guide will help you deploy the UFDev Agency website to Vercel. Follow these steps to ensure a successful deployment.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with your project code
- A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you don't have one)
- Node.js version 18 or higher

## Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Ensure your project has the correct configuration files:

1. Make sure your `package.json` has the necessary dependencies:
   - `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` should be in both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`
   - The build script should include installing these dependencies: `"build": "npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer && next build"`

2. Verify you have these configuration files:
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
   - `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
   - `.npmrc` - NPM configuration with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
   - `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

## Step 2: GitHub Repository

1. Commit all your changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

## Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New..." and select "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Build Command**: Leave as default (uses the one from package.json)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
   - **Development Command**: `npm run dev`

5. Environment Variables (add these if needed):
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
   - `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`
   - Any other environment variables your app needs

6. Click "Deploy"

## Step 4: Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Tailwind CSS Not Found**:
   - Check your package.json to ensure tailwindcss is in regular dependencies
   - Verify your build command installs tailwindcss first

2. **Module Resolution Issues**:
   - Ensure your .npmrc file has `legacy-peer-deps=true`
   - Check that all config files are using CommonJS format (not ESM)

3. **Next.js Build Issues**:
   - Make sure you're using a compatible Node.js version
   - Check the Vercel build logs for specific errors

## Step 5: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain and follow the verification steps
3. Update DNS records at your domain registrar as instructed by Vercel

## Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically deploys new commits to your main branch. To change this behavior:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Under "Git", modify the production branch or deployment settings

## Important Notes

- The `vercel.json` file overrides Vercel's default build settings
- Changes to environment variables require a redeployment
- Using `.next` as the output directory is important for proper Next.js deployment
