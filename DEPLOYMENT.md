# Deployment Guide for UFDev Agency Website

This guide will help you deploy the UFDev Agency website to Vercel. Follow these steps to ensure a successful deployment.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository with your project code
- A Vercel account (sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) if you don't have one)
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- MongoDB Atlas account (free tier is sufficient)

## Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Atlas (Required for Production)

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas account at [mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
2. Create a new cluster (free tier works fine)
3. Create a database user with password
4. Set network access to allow connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
5. Get your connection string by clicking "Connect" > "Connect your application"
6. Keep this connection string ready for the Vercel deployment

## Step 2: Prepare Your Project

Ensure your project has the correct configuration files:

1. Make sure your `package.json` has the necessary dependencies:
   - `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`
   - `typescript`, `critters`, and related ESLint packages
   - The build script should include installing these dependencies

2. Verify you have these configuration files:
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS configuration
   - `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS configuration
   - `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration
   - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
   - `.npmrc` - NPM configuration with `legacy-peer-deps=true`
   - `vercel.json` - Vercel deployment configuration

## Step 3: GitHub Repository

1. Commit all your changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New..." and select "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure the project:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js
   - **Build Command**: Leave as default (uses the one from package.json)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`
   - **Development Command**: `npm run dev`

5. Environment Variables (add these if needed):
   - `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string **(REQUIRED for Full Functionality)**
   - `NODE_ENV` - Set to `production`
   - Any other environment variables your app needs

   > **IMPORTANT**: While the site will build without MONGODB_URI, for actual production use with working contact forms, you MUST provide a valid MongoDB connection string. Without it, contact form submissions will not be saved.

6. Click "Deploy"

## Step 5: Troubleshooting

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Missing Dependencies**:
   - Check if you've added all required dependencies: `typescript`, `critters`, etc.
   - Make sure you have the proper TypeScript configuration files

2. **MongoDB Connection Issues**:
   - Verify your MongoDB Atlas cluster is properly set up
   - Ensure your connection string has the correct username, password and database name
   - Test the connection in development before deploying

3. **ESLint or TypeScript Issues**:
   - Ensure your tsconfig.json is properly configured
   - If needed, temporarily disable ESLint by adding `NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1` to environment variables

## Step 6: Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain and follow the verification steps
3. Update DNS records at your domain registrar as instructed by Vercel

## Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically deploys new commits to your main branch. To change this behavior:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Under "Git", modify the production branch or deployment settings

## Important Notes

- The `vercel.json` file overrides Vercel's default build settings
- Changes to environment variables require a redeployment
- Using `.next` as the output directory is important for proper Next.js deployment
- For testing builds without MongoDB, the system will use a placeholder connection, but this is **not suitable for production**
